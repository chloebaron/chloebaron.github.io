                    <p><b>Role</b>: UX Designer. Conducted interviews, designed paper and digital wireframes, low and high fidelity prototyping, conducted usability studies, accounted for accessibility, and iterated on designs.</p>
                    <p><b>The Problem</b> is art galleries and museums are not always accessible to those who are unfamiliar with art or require assistance. <b>The Goal</b> of this design was to provide a resource that allows all visitors to access the art and information in a way that is equitable. </p>
                    <p>Two of the primary user groups identified through creating <b>aggregate personas</b>, both were identified adults. The first group had schedules did not align with the gallery’s events and the second was users that <b>felt excluded</b> and unsupported at the gallery with the <b>lack of inclusive signage or assistive technology</b>. </p>
