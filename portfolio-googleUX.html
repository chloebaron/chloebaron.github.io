                    <p><b>The Problem</b> is art galleries and museums are not always accessible to those who are unfamiliar with art or require assistance. <b>The Goal</b> of this design was to provide a resource that allows all visitors to access the art and information in a way that is equitable. </p>
                    <p>Two of the primary user groups identified through creating <b>aggregate personas</b>, both were identified adults.

                    <p><b>Role</b>: UX Designer. Conducted interviews, designed paper and digital wireframes, low and high fidelity prototyping, conducted usability studies, accounted for accessibility, and iterated on designs.</p>
                    <p><b>The Problem</b> Users often miss out on events, they can’t learn about the accessibility options, and find the ticketing flow to be painful.  <b>The Goal</b> of this design was to design a ticketing flow that users will enjoy and find useful and informative of accessibility options.  </p>
                    <p>I created personas and empathy maps to understand <b>pain points</b> and user's needs. Two of the primary user groups identified through creating aggregate personas, both were identified as adults. The first group found <b>purchasing tickets online to be frustratingly complex</b> and the second was users that <b>felt excluded by the lack of accessibility information for events</b>.</p>

                    <p><b>The Problem</b> Users of this demographic have a difficult experience connecting with mentors and  locating documents in one easy space.  <b>The Goal</b> To develop a responsive, mobile first website that provides career coaching resources for formerly incarcerated persons. The aim is to build a site that is easy to navigate regardless of digital literacy rate and will provide mentorship access in a way that is not currently available.  </p>
