                <h1>Case Study I | Design a Simple App for an Art Gallery</h1>
                <!-- <h4>Role & Responsibilities</h4> -->
                <div class="study-details">
                    <p><b>Role</b>: UX Designer. Conducted interviews, designed paper and digital wireframes, low and high fidelity prototyping, conducted usability studies, accounted for accessibility, and iterated on designs.</p>
                    <p><b>The Problem</b> is art galleries and museums are not always accessible to those who are unfamiliar with art or require assistance. <b>The Goal</b> of this design was to provide a resource that allows all visitors to access the art and information in a way that is equitable. </p>
                    <p>The initial design was aimed to create a <b>simple guide</b> for an art gallery or museum. It focuses on providing access to information about art for all users, specifically to those users  who want to learn about art or may require assistive technologies. </p>
                    <p>Two of the primary user groups identified through creating <b>aggregate personas</b>, both were identified adults. The first group had schedules did not align with the gallery’s events and the second was users that <b>felt excluded</b> and unsupported at the gallery with the <b>lack of inclusive signage or assistive technology</b>. </p>
                    <p>Mapping the user journeys revealed a lot of pain points that persons with visual impairments experience. The pain points would extend to a number of other persons such as young learners or those new to the gallery</p>
                    <!-- <p>Initial Design concepts</p> -->
                    <!-- Sketches and Wireframes -->
                    <p>The app will suggest similar art for the user to learn discover. Users reported that <b>giving more context</b> to understand why the art was similar to another piece would be helpful.</p>
                    <!-- User testing results -->
                   <p>The prototype and mock ups usability test echoed the consensus that users liked the favourites feature but said a <b>filter to search</b> and categorization by visit or date would make it it most useful</p> 
                    <!-- Conclusion and next steps -->
                    <p>Conclusion and Accessibility considerations: <b>Audio Descriptions</b> for those with visual or learning impairments. Also benefits visitors who don’t feel comfortable standing for too long in a crowd to read a description.</p>

                <h1>Case Study II | Design a Ticketing Flow for a Music Venue</h1>
                <div class="study-details">
                    <p><b>Role</b>: UX Designer. Conducted interviews, designed paper and digital wireframes, low and high fidelity prototyping, conducted usability studies, accounted for accessibility, and iterated on designs.</p>
                    <p><b>The Problem</b> Users often miss out on events, they can’t learn about the accessibility options, and find the ticketing flow to be painful.  <b>The Goal</b> of this design was to design a ticketing flow that users will enjoy and find useful and informative of accessibility options.  </p>
                    <p>The initial concept was to design a local ticketing platform for events at a venue in Bermuda. Focusing on effective advertisements to events and a<b>simple check out process</b>.</p>
                    <p>I created personas and empathy maps to understand <b>pain points</b> and user's needs. Two of the primary user groups identified through creating aggregate personas, both were identified as adults. The first group found <b>purchasing tickets online to be frustratingly complex</b> and the second was users that <b>felt excluded by the lack of accessibility information for events</b>.</p>
                    <!-- <p>Key Challenges or Restraints</p> -->
                    <p><b>Sitemap considerations:</b> Complex check out processes were a pain point for users so I used that knowledge to create a sitemap.My goal was to have minimal steps to complete the checkout process.
                        </p>
                    <!-- <p>Initial Design concepts</p> -->
                    <!-- Sketches and Wireframes -->
                    <p>In the <b>wireframe designs</b>, we wanted it to be easy for users to go straight to finding events and begin booking. The mobile is very similar to the web version to allow for a <b>smooth transition between screens.</b></p>
                    <!-- User testing results -->
                    <p>We conducted remote moderated usability studies with participants ranging from age 25-50. We measured by taking notes of users attitudes, actions, and ratings on a scale.</p>
                    <p>Usability tests revealed that the <b>seating selection was unclear</b> during the initial prototype. Users also preferred to search for events via the navbar rather than the search in the hero image. Based on the insights from the study, we removed the search bar for events as users went to the navbar to search. We also moved the ‘more events’ button to the top rather than the bottom as no one clicked there.</p>
                    <!-- Mock ups -->
                    <!-- Conclusion and next steps -->
                    <p>Conclusions: Pain points that I thought were priorities for myself are universal, but they are not. Usability tests are an <b>indispensable tool</b> for discovering improvements. Accessibility icons are already a feature of the site. Making sure these are labeled correctly and take a wide array of considerations into account.</p>

                <h1>Case Study III | Tech for Good: Design a Career Coaching Site</h1>
                <div class="study-details">
                    <p><b>Role</b>: UX Designer. Conducted interviews, designed paper and digital wireframes, low and high fidelity prototyping, conducted usability studies, accounted for accessibility, and iterated on designs.</p>
                    <p><b>The Problem</b> Formerly incarcerated persons have a difficult experience connecting with mentors and  locating documents in one easy space.  <b>The Goal</b> To develop a responsive, mobile first website that provides career coaching resources for formerly incarcerated persons. The aim is to build a site that is easy to navigate regardless of digital literacy rate and will provide mentorship access in a way that is not currently available.  </p>
                    <p>I created personas and empathy maps to understand <b>pain points</b> and user's needs. Two of the primary user groups identified through creating aggregate personas, both were identified as adults. The first group found networking and mentorship access <b>not readily available</b> while the second found <b>business advice and mentorship hard to access</b>.</p>
                    <!-- <p>Key Challenges or Restraints</p> -->
                    <p>The <b>initial design concept</b> was to identify the key features that could be designed in the app. While the <b>browser based site</b> focuses on mentor matching, it was important to keep access to the <b>core information</b> on the site in the same format. Often users will only have access via <b>mobile or tablet</b> so it is best to keep this section without a lot of frills and basic.</p>
                    
                    <p>We conducted remote moderated usability studies with participants ranging from age 25-50. We measured by taking notes of users attitudes, actions, and ratings on a scale.</p>
                    <p><b>Mock Ups Final Design</b> are based on the insights from the study showing confusion in navigation. We added a home button on the mobile screen and a complete list of pages in the navbar for tablet and web.</p>  
                    <!-- Conclusion and next steps -->
                    <p><b>Next Steps:</b> Another round of usability studies for all three screen sizes. Going back to ensure navigation is as easy to understand for a wide range of skill levels. Adding more iconography throughout the application and a full design of the mentor matching steps.</p>
